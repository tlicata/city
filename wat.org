Like SimCity, but for Lockport (or any town).

* What should it do?

- model traffic & roads & signals
- model neighborhoods & real-estate
- model police & crime
- model fire & emergency
- model schools
- model taxes & costs
- model local government & bonds
- be fun
- model up and coming events?
- model skatepark?

* But, how?

- Google maps? Generate own map (tiles)? Minecraft?
- User-edited, via pull requests.
- Cartoonish, SimCity-like interface? I can't art. Can Paul?
- Integrate with local government? Wards?
- Start small, only part of city? Downtown? Build out.

* Implementation...

- Simulations need distributed computing?
  + Or can all be done on client (browser?)
  + Just drawing on client will be expensive...
  + erlang backend + javascript frontend
  + clojure + cljs? (shared code)
  + write the whole thing in javascript
    + nodejs deployments

- Model vs View
- It's a map
- It's SimCity
- Needs timeline / scrubbing
- It's almost like the financial/charting projection work
- It relates to Kman's map coloring work
- Erlang, like distributed model trains
- Queryable
- Fast

** Why Erlang?
 I don't need real-time?

 Program multi-core. Multi-computer.
