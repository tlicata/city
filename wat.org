Like SimCity, but for Lockport.

* What should it do?

- model traffic & roads
- model police & fire & schools
- model neighborhoods
- model taxes & costs
- model local government

* But, how?

- Google maps? Generate own map (tiles)?
- Cartoonish, SimCity-like interface? I can't art. Can Paul?
- Integrate with local government? Wards?
- Start small, only part of city? Downtown? Build out.

* Implementation...

- Simulations need distributed computing?
  + Or can all be done on client (browser?)
  + Just drawing on client will be expensive...

- Model vs View
- It's a map
- It's SimCity
- Needs timescrubbing
- It's almost like the financial/charting projection work
- It relates to Kman's map coloring work
- Erlang, like distributed model trains
- Queryable
- Fast
